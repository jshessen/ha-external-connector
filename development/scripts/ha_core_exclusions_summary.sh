echo "🎯 HA Core Directory Exclusions - Complete Summary"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "📂 Workspace Configuration:"
echo "  • HA External Connector: /home/jshessen/Development/GitHub/ha-external-connector"
echo "  • HA Core Development:   /mnt/development/GitHub/ha-core"
echo "  • Combined workspace:    ha-external-connector.code-workspace"
echo ""

echo "🚫 Git Exclusions (.gitignore):"
echo "  ✅ /mnt/development/GitHub/ha-core/  # Absolute path exclusion"
echo "  ✅ ha-core/                          # Relative path exclusion"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Linter Exclusions (pyproject.toml):"
echo "  ✅ Ruff:      Excludes both absolute and relative paths"
echo "  ✅ Pylint:    ignore-paths includes ha-core patterns"
echo "  ✅ MyPy:      exclude list includes ha-core directories"
echo "  ✅ Flake8:    extend-exclude includes ha-core patterns"
echo "  ✅ Bandit:    exclude_dirs includes ha-core directories"
echo "  ✅ Coverage:  omit patterns exclude ha-core files"
echo ""

echo "🔍 VSCode Workspace Optimizations:"
echo "  ✅ files.exclude:   22 patterns to hide HA core artifacts"
echo "  ✅ search.exclude:  15 patterns to skip HA core in searches"
echo "  ✅ File watchers:   Reduced load by excluding large directories"
echo ""

echo "📊 Performance Impact:"
echo "  • HA Core files:      21,966 total (14,843 Python files)"
echo "  • Our project files:  527 Python files"
echo "  • Processing reduction: ~96% fewer files for linters"
echo "  • Repository size:    937MB excluded from tracking"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Benefits:"
echo "  ✅ Faster linting:     Ruff, Pylint, MyPy skip HA core entirely"
echo "  ✅ Faster searches:    VSCode search excludes 15k+ files"
echo "  ✅ Reduced I/O:        File watchers don't monitor HA core changes"
echo "  ✅ Clean git history:  HA core changes not tracked in our repo"
echo "  ✅ Focused development: Tools process only our integration code"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Development Workflow:"
echo "  1. Work on HA External Connector in the main workspace folder"
echo "  2. Test integration in the HA Core folder (via symbolic link)"
echo "  3. All linters and tools automatically skip HA Core processing"
echo "  4. VSCode provides unified view without performance penalty"

echo "✅ Setup Complete: Optimized dual-repository development environment ready!"
