This directory contains infrastructure-related files for the Home Assistant External Connector project.

## üìã Purpose

This directory is reserved for:

- **Deployment configurations** - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files
- **AWS CloudFormation templates** - Service deployment definitions
- **Terraform configurations** - Infrastructure provisioning
- **Docker files** - Containerization configurations
- **CI/CD pipeline definitions** - Deployment automation

## üöß Current Status

This directory is currently empty as the infrastructure components are being developed as part of the Python migration.

## üîÆ Planned Infrastructure

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding infrastructure files:

1. **Organize by service type** (aws/, cloudflare/, etc.)
2. **Include environment-specific configurations** (dev/, staging/, prod/)
3. **Add proper documentation** for each infrastructure component
4. **Update this README** to reflect new additions
5. **Follow infrastructure best practices** for security and maintainability
