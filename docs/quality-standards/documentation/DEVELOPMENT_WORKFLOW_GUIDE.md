# Development Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Project Structure Overview

This project is now **HACS-ready** with a clean, professional structure optimized for both community users and active development.

### 📁 Root Directory (HACS Presentation)

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Quick Development Commands

```bash
# Environment activation (always first)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Quick quality check
python development/scripts/agent_helper.py env

# Code quality assurance
python development/scripts/code_quality.py

# Run comprehensive tests
pytest tests/ -v

# HACS integration testing
python development/scripts/test_hacs_integration.py
```

### VS Code Tasks Available

### HACS Compliance

- ✅ Custom component structure following HA best practices
- ✅ Proper manifest.json with all required fields
- ✅ Config flow implementation for UI setup
- ✅ Services registration and validation
- ✅ Professional documentation structure
- ✅ Clean root directory presentation

## 🎯 HACS Publication Readiness

### Structure Benefits

1. **Clean Presentation**: Root directory contains only essential files
2. **Development Preserved**: All tools organized in development/
3. **Quality Visible**: Tests and quality metrics clearly demonstrated
4. **Professional Standards**: Following HACS and HA core best practices

### Next Steps for HACS

1. **Load Test**: Install in Home Assistant development environment
2. **Integration Validation**: Verify config flow and services work correctly
3. **Community Testing**: Share with beta testers for feedback
4. **HACS Submission**: Submit to HACS repository for publication

## 📚 Key Documentation

- **Deployment**: `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## 🔄 Continuous Development

### Adding New Features

1. Work in `custom_components/ha_external_connector/`
2. Use development tools from `development/scripts/`
3. Maintain quality standards with automated tools
4. Update tests to demonstrate quality

### Maintaining Quality

```bash
# Before committing changes
python development/scripts/code_quality.py
pytest tests/ -v

# Automated quality assurance
source .venv/bin/activate
python development/scripts/agent_helper.py all
```
