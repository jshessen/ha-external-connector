# Integration Framework

This section contains documentation for integrating external services and platforms
with Home Assistant, including voice assistants, mobile platforms, and cloud services.

## Current Integrations

### Alexa Smart Home (Production Ready ✅)

The Alexa integration serves as the architectural foundation and reference
implementation for all future external integrations.

- **[SMAPI_SETUP_GUIDE.md](alexa/SMAPI_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Amazon developer
  console configuration
- **[TEAM_SETUP.md](alexa/TEAM_SETUP.md)** - Multi-user configuration guide
- **[PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](alexa/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md)** -
  Sub-500ms response time optimization

**Status:** Production deployment with sub-500ms response times and enterprise security

## Future Integrations

### Google Assistant (Q2 2025 Target)

Structure prepared for Google Smart Home Actions implementation:

- Directory: `google-assistant/` (ready for development)
- Target: Feature parity with Alexa integration performance and security
- Platform: Google Cloud Functions with Firebase integration

### iOS Companion (Q3 2025 Target)

Structure prepared for iOS companion app integration:

- Directory: `ios-companion/` (ready for development)
- Platform: CloudFlare Workers with Apple Sign-In integration
- Features: Real-time notifications, location-based automation

### Android Companion (Q4 2025 Target)

Structure prepared for Android companion integration:

- Directory: `android-companion/` (ready for development)
- Platform: Firebase Cloud Messaging with Google authentication
- Features: Background automation, Android Auto integration

## Integration Development Pattern

All integrations follow the established architectural pattern:

### Component Structure

```text
integration-framework/{platform}/
├── user-guides/              # End-user documentation
├── setup-guides/             # Configuration instructions
├── performance/              # Optimization documentation
└── troubleshooting/          # Issue resolution guides
```

### Communication Flow

1. **External Request** → Platform Service (Alexa/Google/Mobile)
2. **Platform Processing** → Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Google Cloud/CloudFlare)
3. **Authentication** → OAuth gateway with credential validation
4. **Home Assistant API** → Secure tunnel through CloudFlare Access
5. **Response** → Sub-500ms round-trip to user
