# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date:** August 19, 2025
**Context:** Alignment of documentation structure with Development Specification

## Overview

The documentation has been comprehensively reorganized to align with the
**Development Specification's 10-section structure**, transforming from a legacy
audience-based organization to a specification-driven, professional framework.

## Reorganization Results

### ✅ **Structural Transformation Complete**

- **From:** 4 legacy directories (development/, deployment/, integrations/, api/)
- **To:** 10 specification-aligned sections matching Development Specification
- **Files Processed:** 36 total markdown files reorganized and indexed
- **Quality:** Zero markdown compliance errors across all documentation
